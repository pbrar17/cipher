The Cipher App has its own README that highlights and descirbes its use cases and abilities in detail, this is only to help the user know how to navigate the directory. 
In order to run the cipher app, you need to run the main file located in the SRC/Main/UI Folder. This will allow the user to chose between both the GUI version or the console based version. 
More Information on the Cipher App itself, can be found in the README located in the Directory itself. 
All code in this directory is considered written by me, unless otherwise indicated.
